# Voyager - Script Transfer and Execution Tool

Voyager is a Python-based program designed to streamline the process of transferring Bash scripts or Python files from a user's local machine to a remote server. It allows users to seamlessly execute scripts on a remote server and receive the results back to their local machine. Whether you need to manage and run scripts on a remote server or automate tasks, Voyager simplifies the process.

## Features

- **Script Transfer**: Easily transfer Bash scripts or Python files from your local machine to a remote server with a single command.

- **Remote Execution**: Execute scripts on a remote server, allowing you to manage and run tasks without leaving your local environment.

- **Result Retrieval**: Retrieve the results of script execution on the remote server and view them on your local machine.

## Directory Structure

The Voyager repository is organized into the following directories:

- `asset/`: Contains assets such as documentation, images, or configuration files.

- `dependency/`: Houses any external dependencies or libraries required by the Voyager program.

- `pkg/`: Contains Python packages or modules used by Voyager.

- `script/`: This directory is intended for storing your Bash scripts or Python files that you wish to transfer and execute remotely.
